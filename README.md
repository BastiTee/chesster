# Chesster

A chess training partner containing

* a standalone server application including a frontend for any UCI-compatible chess engine (e.g. [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)) and [pgnextract](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/)
* a console client to play stockfish
* a client to analyse chess games
* a pgn post-processing frontend

This project relies on other awesome GitHub projects 

* [Bottle.py - micro-framework for python web-applications](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
* [Chessnut - python chess model](https://github.com/cgearhart/Chessnut)

This project is barely in alfa state and more or less a playground.
